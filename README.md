# Brain-Stroke-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to brain strokes to identify key factors contributing to the occurrence of strokes.
The goal is to provide insights using data analysis techniques to predict the likelihood of strokes based on various health and demographic factors.

Key aspects of the analysis include:

Exploring relationships between features like age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and stroke occurrence.
Using statistical techniques and visualizations to understand patterns and correlations.
Building predictive models to assess stroke risk using machine learning algorithms.
